This folder will contain the code that can help execute all or a subset of tests. There can be many 
different ways of executing a series of tests, for example, Ansible is one of the ways to execute the tests. 

The executor helps with performing batch execution of Litmus tests with ability to select/skip tests & 
consolidate results or for dashboarding purposes.
