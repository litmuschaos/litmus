  Chaos Experiment is a set of different operations coupled together to achieve
  desired chaos impact on a Kubernetes Cluster. It is useful in automating a
  series of pre-conditioning steps or action which is necessary to be performed
  before triggering the chaos injection. A Chaos Experiment can also be used to
  perform different operations paralleled to achieve a desired chaos injection
  experiment.

  The command probe allows developers to run shell commands and match the

  probe was to allow users to implement a non-standard & imperative way of

  for specific data within a database, parse the value out of a JSON blob being
  dumped into a certain path, or check for the existence of a particular string
  in the service logs.

promDescription: >-
  Allows users to define metrics-based SLOs in a declarative way and determine
  the experiment verdict based on its success.
promProbeDetails: >-
  The promProbe allows users to run Prometheus queries and match the resulting
  output against specific conditions. The intent behind this probe is to allow
  users to define metrics-based SLOs in a declarative way and determine the
  experiment verdict based on its success. The probe runs the query on a
  Prometheus server defined by the endpoint, and checks whether the output
  satisfies the specified criteria. A PromQL query needs to be provided, whose
  outcome is then used for the probe validation.
