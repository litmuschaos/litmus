  You can configure and tune your chaos infrastructure, and download the
  deployment manifest . This manifest is applied to your Kubernetes cluster.
  Below mentioned Kubernetes permissions are required to install chaos
  infrastructure:
  Chaos Experiment is a set of different operations coupled together to achieve
  desired chaos impact on a Kubernetes Cluster. It is useful in automating a
  series of pre-conditioning steps or action which is necessary to be performed
  before triggering the chaos injection. A Chaos Experiment can also be used to
  perform different operations paralleled to achieve a desired chaos injection
  experiment.
  Kubernetes Chaos Infrastructures are the target deployments that are synced
  with your source manifests.
  Click on the “Download” button below to download the YML file to a machine
  where you have kubectl installed and have access to your Kubernetes cluster.
  Changes to your tune fault configuration will be lost if you do not apply your
  changes.
  Allows LitmusChaos to perform and monitor chaos in all namespaces in the
  cluster.
  Allows developers to run shell commands and match the resulting output as part
  of the entry/exit criteria.
  The command probe allows developers to run shell commands and match the
  resulting output as part of the entry/exit criteria. The intent behind this
  probe was to allow users to implement a non-standard & imperative way of
  expressing their hypothesis. For example, the cmdProbe enables you to check
  for specific data within a database, parse the value out of a JSON blob being
  dumped into a certain path, or check for the existence of a particular string
  in the service logs.
  Open your target cluster and run the following command to connect to your
  kubernetes infrastructure
  Note - It seems the cluster you have selected already has a cluster scope
  chaos access on it, either remove it or continue with namespace mode.

  options:
    option1:

  Copy the downloaded YML to a machine where you have kubectl installed and have
  access to your Kubernetes cluster.
  3. Copy the downloaded YML to a machine where you have kubectl installed and
  have access to your Kubernetes cluster.
  The experiment will run periodically according to the cron provided below. You
  can stop the schedule anytime you want.
  All YAML files use these default values provided by Litmus. These values
  cannot be changed.
  Deletes all the experiment runs from the chaos control plane. This will also
  stop all experiments runs that are running.
  Deletes the probe and all the associations with experiment runs from the chaos
  control plane. This will also misplace any analytics that had incurred for the
  previous runs for this probe.
  We recommend you to create a new Experiment in case of addition/deletion of
  faults or probes, as editing experiments with new faults or probes,
  co-relation of analytics might get impacted.
  When you edit directly on the existing experiment, you will not be able to
  change the name and target environment/infrastructures of this experiment. And
  your current experiment with run history will be overwritten.
  In order to run Chaos Experiments, you need to enable chaos infrastructure in
  the Environments
  An environment is the place where you will deploy your cluster for chaos
  testing

  Allows developers to run HTTP commands and match the resulting output as part
  of the entry/exit criteria.
  The httpProbe allows developers to specify a URL which the experiment uses to
  gauge health/service availability (or other custom conditions) as part of the
  entry/exit criteria. The received status code is mapped against an expected
  status. It supports http Get and Post methods.
  This infrastructure is Inactive as your deployment may have encountered a
  problem. Please check the deployment logs
  Run the following command to apply the Chaos infrastructure to your Kubernetes
  Cluster
  Your infrastructure has been registered. The infrastructure takes up to 3-5
  minutes to be available for chaos testing. You can check the status in
  Environment -> Infrastructure list.
  Addresses verification of the desired resource state by allowing users to
  define the Kubernetes GVR (group-version-resource) with appropriate filters
  (field selectors/label selectors)
  The k8sProbe addresses verification of the desired resource state by allowing
  users to define the Kubernetes GVR (group-version-resource) with appropriate
  filters (field selectors/label selectors). The experiment makes use of the
  Kubernetes Dynamic Client to achieve this. It supports create, delete, present
  and absent operations.
  Note: If you have another Kubernetes chaos infrastructure on this cluster
  under a different namespace then skip the below step (2)
  Note: Please download the chaos infrastructure manifest from the menu and run
  the following command on your Kubernetes cluster to clean up the
  infrastructure resources

  Allows users to define metrics-based SLOs in a declarative way and determine
  the experiment verdict based on its success.
  The promProbe allows users to run Prometheus queries and match the resulting
  output against specific conditions. The intent behind this probe is to allow
  users to define metrics-based SLOs in a declarative way and determine the
  experiment verdict based on its success. The probe runs the query on a
  Prometheus server defined by the endpoint, and checks whether the output
  satisfies the specified criteria. A PromQL query needs to be provided, whose
  outcome is then used for the probe validation.
  This action will remove the probe from the manifest. Are you sure you want to
  continue?
  Latest application resilience measured based on this formula Σ(Weights(fault)
  * Probe Percentage(fault)) / Σ Weights(fault).
  Run controlled 'chaos' experiments to understand how real-world stress and
  failures impact your systems. Create more reliable applications and
  infrastructure.
  Enabling Chaos on infrastructure helps to inject chaos by studying your
  infrastructure and discover services
  Source mode is where the command execution is carried out from within a new
  pod whose image is specified. This is preferred when application-specific
  binaries are required.
  Note: You may check the status of your Chaos Infrastructure in the status
  column of the Chaos Infrastructures screen

  You can drag and drop an experiment YAML file and let Litmus visualize your

  You have selected {{numberOfFaults}} faults in {{experimentName}} experiment.
  Successful outcome of each fault carries a certain weight. We have
