## Introduction

- This experiment consumes the Memory resources on the application container on specified memory in megabytes.
- It simulates conditions where app pods experience Memory spikes either due to expected/undesired processes thereby testing how the overall application stack behaves when this occurs.

## Uses

??? info "View the uses of the experiment" 
    Memory usage within containers is subject to various constraints in Kubernetes. If the limits are specified in their spec, exceeding them can cause termination of the container (due to OOMKill of the primary process, often pid 1) - the restart of the container by kubelet, subject to the policy specified. For containers with no limits placed, the memory usage is uninhibited until such time as the Node level OOM Behaviour takes over. In this case, containers on the node can be killed based on their oom_score and the QoS class a given pod belongs to (bestEffort ones are first to be targeted). This eval is extended to all pods running on the node - thereby causing a bigger blast radius. 

    This experiment launches a stress process within the target container - which can cause either the primary process in the container to be resource constrained in cases where the limits are enforced OR eat up available system memory on the node in cases where the limits are not specified

## Prerequisites

??? info "Verify the prerequisites" 
    - Ensure that Kubernetes Version > 1.16 
    - Ensure that the Litmus Chaos Operator is running by executing <code>kubectl get pods</code> in operator namespace (typically, <code>litmus</code>).If not, install from <a href="https://v1-docs.litmuschaos.io/docs/getstarted/#install-litmus">here</a>
    - Ensure that the <code>pod-memory-hog</code> experiment resource is available in the cluster by executing <code>kubectl get chaosexperiments</code> in the desired namespace. If not, install from <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/api/chaos/master?file=faults/kubernetes/pod-cpu-memory/fault.yaml">here</a> 
    
## Default Validations

??? info "View the default validations" 
    The application pods should be in running state before and after chaos injection.

## Minimal RBAC configuration example (optional)

!!! tip "NOTE"   
    If you are using this experiment as part of a litmus workflow scheduled constructed & executed from chaos-center, then you may be making use of the [litmus-admin](https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-admin-rbac.yaml) RBAC, which is pre installed in the cluster as part of the agent setup.

## Experiment Examples 

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common-tunables-for-all-experiments.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common-tunables-for-pod-experiments.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables. 

### Memory Consumption

It stresses the `MEMORY_CONSUMPTION` MB memory of the targeted pod for the `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-memory-hog/memory-consumption.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# define the memory consumption in MB
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-memory-hog-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-memory-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # memory consumption value
        - name: MEMORY_CONSUMPTION
          value: '500' #in MB
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Workers For Stress

The worker's count for the stress can be tuned with `NUMBER_OF_WORKERS` ENV. 

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-memory-hog/workers.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# number of workers used for the stress
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-memory-hog-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-memory-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # number of workers for stress
        - name: NUMBER_OF_WORKERS
          value: '1'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```

### Container Runtime Socket Path

It defines the `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` and `SOCKET_PATH` ENV to set the container runtime and socket file path.

- `CONTAINER_RUNTIME`: It supports `docker`, `containerd`, and `crio` runtimes. The default value is `docker`.
- `SOCKET_PATH`: It contains path of docker socket file by default(`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`). For other runtimes provide the appropriate path.

### Pumba Chaos Library

It specifies the Pumba chaos library for the chaos injection. It can be tuned via `LIB` ENV. The defaults chaos library is `litmus`.
Provide the stress image via `STRESS_IMAGE` ENV for the pumba library.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litmuschaos/litmus/master/mkdocs/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-memory-hog/pumba-lib.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# use the pumba lib for the memory stress
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-memory-hog-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-memory-hog
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # name of chaoslib
        # it supports litmus and pumba lib
        - name: LIB
          value: 'pumba'
        # stress image - applicable for pumba lib only
        - name: STRESS_IMAGE
          value: 'alexeiled/stress-ng:latest-ubuntu'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
```
