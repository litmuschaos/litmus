## How do we use Litmus.  
We are using Litmus for the following 3 topics:
- **Identify weakness** by injecting a wide variety of disruptions to catch bugs and gaps in the stability of our applications
- **Build confidence in the resiliency** by introducing disruptions that activate our resiliency mechanisms to ensure they are working as expected.
- **Validate fixes** by recreating specific conditions and disruptions, we can reproduce complex production incidents and validate the fixes deployed to resolve them.

## Benefits in using Litmus.   

We are finding the following benefits in Litmus
- **Open Source**: Allows us to contribute new features and fix bugs based on feedback from our Chaos users.
- **QA-Friendly**: Through the UI and YAML-based configuration, it allows QA profiles with limited SRE knowledge to easily create their own experiments.
- **Extensibility**: As Chaos Scenarios are based on ArgoWorkflow, it allows for the inclusion of custom steps, such as updating a configuration before/after the experiments.
- **Variety of Disruption Types**: Which satisfies our current Chaos users.
