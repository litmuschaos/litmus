### **Why do we use Litmus.**

Resilience is a key aspect in creating fault-tolerant environments, and leveraging tools like Litmus has been instrumental in automating resilience testing. Litmus has enabled us to simulate real-time chaos scenarios, allowing us to thoroughly verify the robustness of both our infrastructure and applications.

### **How do we use Litmus.**

We began with a proof of concept (POC) on a playground cluster. While we explored other tools during this process, Litmus stood out significantly, not only in its capabilities but also due to its excellent user interface. Although we faced a few challenges during the initial setup of Litmus on OpenShift, the team provided timely support, helping us overcome these obstacles and successfully complete the POC.

Now, we've successfully deployed Litmus in a non-production cluster environment, and our SRE team is in the process of transitioning from manual chaos testing to automated chaos tests. This shift will enable us to schedule, automate, and efficiently track the outcomes of these tests, enhancing the resilience of our systems.
