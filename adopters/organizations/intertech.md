## Why do we use Litmus

We use Litmus to proactively validate the resilience of our critical banking infrastructure and ensure our systems can handle real-world failure scenarios before they impact production.

## How do we use Litmus

Litmus is integrated into our SRE practices on our Kubernetes-based infrastructure. We conduct chaos experiments simulating pod failures, network latency, and resource stress to test the resilience of our banking applications and microservices architecture.

## Benefits in using Litmus

Litmus provides a Kubernetes-native, easy-to-implement chaos engineering framework that fits seamlessly into our infrastructure. The ability to create custom experiments allows us to tailor chaos tests specifically for financial systems where downtime is critical. This has significantly improved our incident response readiness and overall system reliability.
