# The number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring.

#
# Counter cache helps to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells.
# In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause the database to skip the read before

# Maximum memory to use for SSTable chunk cache and buffer pooling.

# When not set, the default is calculated as 1/3 of max direct memory (by default, max direct memory

# This pool is allocated off-heap, so is in addition to the memory allocated

# Disk usage threshold that will trigger the database to reclaim some space

#
# If the commit log disk usage exceeds this threshold, the database will flush

# commitlog space will cause more flush activity on less-active
# tables.
#
# The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space
# of the commitlog volume.
#
# The database will still write commit logs while it reclaims space
# from previous commit logs. Therefore, the total disk space "reserved"
# for the commit log should be _at least_ 25% bigger than the value of the
# commitlog_total_space_in_mb configuration parameter. The actual

#
# commitlog_total_space_in_mb: 8192

# The number of memtable flush writer threads per disk and
# the total number of memtables that can be flushed concurrently.
# These are generally a combination of compute and IO bound.
#
# Memtable flushing is more CPU efficient than memtable ingest and a single thread
# can keep up with the ingest rate of a whole server on a single fast disk
# until it temporarily becomes IO bound under contention typically with compaction.
# At that point you need multiple flush threads. At some point in the future
# it may become CPU bound all the time.
#
# You can tell if flushing is falling behind using the MemtablePool.BlockedOnAllocation
# metric, which should be 0. A non-zero metric occurs if threads are blocked waiting on flushing
# to free memory.
#
# memtable_flush_writers defaults to 4 for a single data directory.
# This means that four memtables can be flushed concurrently to the single data directory.
# If you have multiple data directories the default is one memtable flushing at a time
# but the flush will use a thread per data directory so you will get four or more writers.
#
# Four is generally enough to flush on a fast disk [array] mounted as a single data directory.
# Adding more flush writers will result in smaller more frequent flushes that introduce more
# compaction overhead.
#
# There is a direct tradeoff between number of memtables that can be flushed concurrently
# and flush size and frequency. More is not better you just need enough flush writers
# to never stall waiting for flushing to free memory.
#
# memtable_flush_writers: 4

# endpoint_snitch -- A class that implements the IEndpointSnitch interface. The database uses the
# snitch to locate nodes and route requests. Use only snitch implementations that are bundled with DSE.
#
# THE DATABASE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SWITCH TO AN INCOMPATIBLE SNITCH
# AFTER DATA IS INSERTED INTO THE CLUSTER.  This would cause data loss.
# This means that if you start with the default SimpleSnitch, which
# locates every node on "rack1" in "datacenter1", your only options
# if you need to add another datacenter are GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
# (and the older PFS).  From there, if you want to migrate to an
# incompatible snitch like Ec2Snitch you can do it by adding new nodes
# under Ec2Snitch (which will locate them in a new "datacenter") and
# decommissioning the old nodes.
#
# Supported snitches from Cassandra:
#
# SimpleSnitch:
#    Treats Strategy order as proximity. This can improve cache
#    locality when disabling read repair. Appropriate only for
#    single-datacenter deployments.
#
# GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
#    This should be your go-to snitch for production use.  The rack
#    and datacenter for the local node are defined in
#    cassandra-rackdc.properties and propagated to other nodes via
#    gossip. For migration from the PropertyFileSnitch, uses the cassandra-topology.properties
#    file if it is present.
#
# PropertyFileSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    explicitly configured in cassandra-topology.properties.
#
# Ec2Snitch:
#    Appropriate for EC2 deployments in a single Region. Loads Region
#    and Availability Zone information from the EC2 API. The Region is
#    treated as the datacenter, and the Availability Zone as the rack.
#    Only private IPs are used, so this will not work across multiple
#    Regions.
#
# Ec2MultiRegionSnitch:
#    Uses public IPs as broadcast_address to allow cross-region
#    connectivity. This means you must also set seed addresses to the public
#    IP and open the storage_port or
#    ssl_storage_port on the public IP firewall. For intra-Region
#    traffic, the database will switch to the private IP after
#    establishing a connection.
#
# RackInferringSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by rack and data center, which are
#    assumed to correspond to the 3rd and 2nd octet of each node's IP
#    address, respectively.  Unless this happens to match your
#    deployment conventions, this is best used as an example of
#    writing a custom Snitch class and is provided in that spirit.
#
# DataStax Enterprise (DSE) provides:
#
# com.datastax.bdp.snitch.DseSimpleSnitch:

# Coalescing Strategies #
# Coalescing multiples messages turns out to significantly boost message processing throughput (think doubling or more).
# On bare metal, the floor for packet processing throughput is high enough that many applications won't notice, but in
# virtualized environments, the point at which an application can be bound by network packet processing can be
# surprisingly low compared to the throughput of task processing that is possible inside a VM. It's not that bare metal
# doesn't benefit from coalescing messages, it's that the number of packets a bare metal network interface can process
# is sufficient for many applications such that no load starvation is experienced even without coalescing.
# There are other benefits to coalescing network messages that are harder to isolate with a simple metric like messages
# per second. By coalescing multiple tasks together, a network thread can process multiple messages for the cost of one
# trip to read from a socket, and all the task submission work can be done at the same time reducing context switching
# and increasing cache friendliness of network message processing.
# See CASSANDRA-8692 for details.
