# Authentication options
#
# These options are used if the authenticator option in cassandra.yaml is set to
# com.datastax.bdp.cassandra.auth.DseAuthenticator
#
# The enabled option controls whether the DseAuthenticator will authenticate users. If
# set to true users will be authenticated, if set to false they will not.
# When not set enabled is false.
#
# DseAuthenticator allows multiple authentication schemes to be used at the same time.
# The schemes to be used are controlled by the default_scheme and other_schemes options.
# A driver can select the scheme to use during authentication.
#
# The default_scheme option selects which authentication scheme will be used if the driver
# does not request a specific scheme. This can be one of the following values:
#   internal - plain text authentication using the internal password authenticator
#   ldap     - plain text authentication using the passthrough LDAP authenticator
#   kerberos - GSSAPI authentication using the Kerberos authenticator
# The other_schemes option is a list of schemes that can also be selected for use by a
# driver and can be a list of the above schemes.
#
# The scheme_permissions option controls whether roles need to have permission granted to
# them in order to use specific authentication schemes. These permissions can be granted
# only when the DseAuthorizer is used.
#
# The allow_digest_with_kerberos option controls whether Digest-MD5 authentication is also
# allowed when Kerberos is one of the authentication schemes. If set to false, it will not
# be allowed. You must set allow_digest_with_kerberos to true in analytics clusters to use Hadoop
# inter-node authentication with Hadoop and Spark jobs.
#
# The plain_text_without_ssl controls how the DseAuthenticator reacts to plain text
# authentication requests over unencrypted client connections. It can be one of:
#   block  - block the request with an authentication error
#   warn   - log a warning about the request but allow it to continue
#   allow  - allow the request without any warning
#
# The transitional_mode option allows the DseAuthenticator to operate in a transitional
# mode during setup of authentication in a cluster. This can be one of the following values:
#   disabled   - transitional mode is disabled
#   permissive - Only super users are authenticated and logged in, all other
#                authentication attempts will be logged in as the anonymous user
#   normal     - If credentials are passed they are authenticated. If the
#                authentication is successful then the user is logged in, otherwise
#                the user is logged in as anonymous. If no credentials are passed,
#                then the user is logged in as anonymous
#   strict     - If credentials are passed they are authenticated. If the
#                authentication is successful, the user is logged in. If the
#                authentication fails, an authentication error is returned. If no
