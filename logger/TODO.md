## ITEMS TODO
--------------

- GET SYSTEMD(KUBELET)LOGS OF APPLICATION NODE
- LEVERAGE STERN FLAGS (EX: NAMESPACES, CAN GET KUBE-SYSTEM POD LOGS AS WELL)
- CONSTRUCT STERN CONFIGMAP (ONCE WE USE MORE FLAGS)
- ABILITY TO PARSE/MAP OUT APP-PVC LOGS IN SUPPORT BUNDLE
- ARE THERE USEFUL LOGS NOT SHOWING UP ON STDOUT
- COLOR CODE (STERN DOES THIS IF NOT REDIRECTED TO LOGFILE)
- IDENTIFY PATTERNS ON THE LOGS (FLOODING CASES)

USER FEEDBACK !!!!
